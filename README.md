# HomeBrew Brewing Temp Controller

What better way to incorperate two of my hobbies, homebrewing and making by creating a Homebrew Temp Controller. The original version was built upon an Arduino UNO and only using a single relay for controlling heating. The case could have been better, heck even the high voltage wiring. However I've decided to create MK2 and make everything more 'slick'

MK2 is hosted on this respository with a better case, better wiring more features and function. Mk2 utalizes a Wemos D1 Mini to give a nice little web gui that displays current temp, if heating/cooling is on or off, and the ability to edit the Trigger Temp and the 'delay'. The code may not be pretty, or even this repository, I class myself a noob at all of this but have certainly given it a good run for it's money.

## Features
* Cooling/Heating
* Web Gui
* Change Trig temp via web gui
* Change delay via the web gui
* Display current temp on OLED and web gui
* See at a glance if heating/cooling is active via a NeoPixel

## Build Guide
Please refer to the wiki for build instructions, BOM, wiring diagrams, and any other additional instructions.

## Allot of late nights
A good amount of hours and late nights was put into this project. Even creating this repository and the wiki took some time. It was not possible with out allot of coffee, and I mean ALLOT of coffee, haha. 
If you like this project and have built it and found it useful to have, why not consider buying me a Coffee.
